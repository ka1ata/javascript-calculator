Why did I make this calculator?


I made this calculator to show off my programming skills. With this, I want to impress the people who will assign me their work tasks. I may not have much experience as a QA, but there is a first time for everything, right? I am a very ambitious and hardworking person and I always do my work with great pleasure.
