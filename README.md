Why did I make this calculator?


I made this calculator to show off my programming skills. With this I want to impress the people who will assign me their work tasks. I have been working as a QA Engineer for many years and I can make test plan and test case for your products. You can contact me by email: kalinkalinov2004vr@gmail.com
